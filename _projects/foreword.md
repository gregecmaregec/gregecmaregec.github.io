While animals sometimes utilize sticks and stones as tools, humans have harnessed a sequence of transformative technologies: irrigation, levers, boats, guns, locomotives, electricity, transistors – and recently, scalable applications of artificial intelligence (AI). It could prove to be the most transformative yet.

This project aims to demystify state-of-the-art AI to trade finance professionals, with the explicit goal to gain a better understanding of the landscape of opportunities in utilizing AI in trade finance. To achieve this, this report seeks to establish a foundational understanding of the mechanisms behind modern AI systems, as well as their current limitations and compliance considerations.

Some argue that attributing intelligence, and with it the title of “AI” to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT is inappropriate. As per the real-world use of the word, LLMs have been bundled under the term Artificial Intelligence or at least AI-related in scientific literature, professional networks, regulatory policy, social media, in common discourse, by the creators of LLMs themselves, and by technology companies offering “AI” services. This report too, considers LLMs as a progression in the field of AI.

Each chapter of this report is designed to be complete when read on its own. Should you stumble upon an unfamiliar word of phrase, consider consulting the Wordbook.
