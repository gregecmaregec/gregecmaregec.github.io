As animals occasionally utilize sticks and stones as tools, humans have harnessed a sequence of transformative technologies: irrigation, levers, boats, guns, locomotives, electricity, transistors – and recently, scalable applications of artificial intelligence (AI). This project aims to demystify state-of-the-art AI to trade professionals, with the explicit goal to better understand the opportunities in utilizing AI in facilitating international trade. To achieve this, the report seeks to establish a foundational understanding of the mechanisms behind modern AI systems, including their current limitations and compliance considerations.

Some would argue that attributing intelligence, and with it the title of “AI” to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT is inappropriate. For the real-world use of the word, LLMs have been bundled under the term Artificial Intelligence or at least AI-related in scientific literature, professional networks, regulatory policy, social media, in common discourse, by the creators of LLMs themselves, and by technology companies offering “AI” services. This report too, considers LLMs as a progression in the field of AI.

Each section of this report is designed to be complete when read on its own. Should you stumble upon an unfamiliar word of phrase, consider consulting the Wordbook.
