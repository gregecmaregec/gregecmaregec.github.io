#### Electrcity consumption and AI

Large language models use a lot of electricity to train and operate – and approximately 2/3 of the world’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels. Trade finance professionals should weigh the potential benefits of AI solutions against their environmental costs when considering how to sustainably support International Trade.

AI systems are trained and hosted the biggest computer clusters in the world, i.e. datacentres. 

The electrcity consumption by AI systems raises questions which could get more pressing in the future about the environmental impact and sustainability thereof. As we continue to advance these technologies, trade finance professional must grapple with the ethical implications of potentially exacerbating climate change in pursuit of workflow optimization.

A Goldman Sachs report estimates that currently, data centres account for 1-2% of electricity usage worldwide, and project it to rise to 3-4% until 2030. Furthermore, the same report claims that Europe will need to spend $1 Trillion by 2030 to prepare its power grid for AI. A hefty sum.

While training neural networks is energy intensive, it currently pales in comparison to other sources of carbon emissions. The academic paper “The Carbon Footprint of Machine Learning Training Will Plateau, Then Shrink” by Patterson et al, 2022 estimates that the training of GPT-3 from OpenAI produced 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the lifetime emissions of roughly 30 average American internal combustion cars. The training stage is the most energy intensive stage of modern AI systems.

#### Electricity generation trends

Before drawing conclusions on whether it is responsible to utilize energy for incorporating AI solutions into facilitating International Trade, a boarder context regarding electricity generation and consumption should be considered.

Worthy of consideration is that the trend of total energy supply of the world is steadily rising, with or without AI.
