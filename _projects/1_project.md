As animals occasionally utilize sticks and stones as tools; the human beings command atom bombs, guns, artificial germs, transistors - and most recently, scalable applications of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). Some argue that attributing intelligence, and with it the title of “AI” to Large Language Models (“LLMs”) like ChatGPT is inappropriate. As per the real-world use of the word, LLMs have been adopted under the term Artificial Intelligence or at least AI-related in academic literature, media, social networks, political debates, regulatory policy, common discourse, by the creators of language models themselves, and by world’s biggest technology companies offering you “AI” services. This submission too, considers current LLMs as a progression in the field of AI.
