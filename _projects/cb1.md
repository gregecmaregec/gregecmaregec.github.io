#### SUMMARY

<br>
• I am currenntly 24 years old<br>
<br>
I grew up in a small village in Slovenia.<br>
• Moved to Germany in break year out of self-initiative after completion of bachelor studies in Slovenia, with a headful of dreams. Started to work as a bartender while working as a remote working student for a Slovenian company, hoping to get the opportunity to study my Master degree in Germany and get career experience.<br>
• During the break year: accepted to one of Germany’s top universities (University of Mannheim), awarded a scholarship to study in Germany (DAAD), and completed a traineeship at Banco Santander’s Trade Finance division in Frankfurt, working on some of the largest transactions in Europe. <br>
<br>
During Master studies:<br><br>
• Completed two internships: at big4 in IT audit, and in Germany’s best bank (Commerzbank!), area Software Development. <br>
• Google Developer Groups on Campus Mannheim – main Tech Lead, host of programming lectures<br>
• Mannheim Investment Club (MIC) – member of the education and investment teams, host of finance lectures<br>
• [ITFA EL Trade Financier of the year 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itfa-org_annualconference-cyprus-itfacyprus2024-activity-7240387292995977216-ai-y/)award in Cyprus, sponsored by Africa Global Trade Finance<br>
• Built an [end-to-end encrypted AI chat tool](https://gregormihelac.com/osai/), serving private inference from a locally configured server setup. Note: it is not always available, due to the server also being my personal PC. Also: the API I built serving from gmserver.xyz is most likely blocked from your company devices.<br>
• Improved German to fluent level (C1), started to learn Spanish, and Chinese at a conversational level.<br>
• Fishing my master’s studies a semester earlier than the standard period of study (in March 2025).<br>
