## What Is a Cookie?

As is common practice with almost all websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. I will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.

## How I Use Cookies

I use cookies for a variety of reasons, but usually the only cookie on this website will be used for setitng a dark/light theme by changing the value according to user's choice. You may confirm this in your browser's cookie viewer. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. You may delete cookies at any time after visiting this website.

## Disabling Cookies

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. 

## More Information

Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. And, as was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case they do interact with one of the features you use on my site.

However, if you are still looking for more information, or you would like help with removing your cookies on this website completely, then you can contact me through:
