## What Is a Cookie?

As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how I use it, and why I sometimes need to store these cookies. I will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.

## How I Use Cookies

I use cookies for a variety of reasons, such as setting a dark/light theme, preventing glitchy autoscroll, allowing certain code to execute etc. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use. You may delete cookies at any time after visiting my website.

## Disabling Cookies

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.

## Site preferences cookies

In order to provide you with a great experience on this site, I provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember your preferences, I need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page affected by your preferences.

## Third-Party Cookies

In some special cases, I also use cookies provided by trusted third parties.

From time to time, I test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered. When I am still testing new features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience while on the site, ensuring I understand which optimizations my users appreciate the most.

## More Information

Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. And, as was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case they do interact with one of the features you use on my site.

However, if you are still looking for more information, or you would like help with remove your cookies on this website completely, then you can contact me through:
