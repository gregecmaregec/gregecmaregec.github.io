<br>
`1`

The self is not an illusion of the mind, in the way illusion is interpreted.<br>
Much like an axe is not an illusion of the mind, since it can cut and shape a real tree.<br>

So is the illusion of the self, not an illusion - It can cut and shape reality itself.

<br>
`2`

The universe is not a story - but the peception of it, most certainly is. <br>
Thus the famous question goes: Why did the chicken cross the road? The answer? To get to the other side.

<br>
`3`

Money, at its core, is a ritual representation of trust.<br>

What good is the currency of a country which no one trusts to see another day?

<br>
`4`

The universe is certain.<br>

Even if in the quantum realm things really are uncertain in the final anaylsis of things,<br>
their uncertainty is already integrated into the universe.<br>
The certainty encapsulating the uncertain, makes it certain.<br>
A certain uncertainty itself is certain. <br>

The universe has already adjusted to this.<br>
You should, too.

<br>
`5`

Whoever understands the origin of the Universe as hydrogen and heat, from which everything arose:<br>

understands that either everything is conscious - <br>
or nothing is.

<br>
`6`

Only when you understand there is no free will, <br>
through both deep meditation and exploration of the scientific method and analysis of its results,<br>
only then can you notice your thoughts arising from the darkness,<br>
and willfully begin to steer them.<br>

Only when you realize with absolute certainty that there is no free will; <br>
that humans are but a biological algorithm for processing data,<br>
only then, can you experience free will for the first time.<br>

True words seem paradoxical.

<br>
`7`

The universe is filled with entropy. <br>
What exsists here on Earth however, behaves rather like a well oiled machine.<br>

The cycles that seem to repeat indefinitely, are divine. <br>
From the laws of physics, to the Hero’s Journey.<br>

Thus God is present on Earth,<br>
and wherever else in the Universe order manifests out of chaos.

<br>
`8`

Every person extrapolates God to the best of their ability. <br>
A person cannot participate in society in any meaningful way unless they do.<br>

What represents your highest ideal? Is it the socialist man, Arjuna, Jesus, or Lao Tzu’s Master? <br>
You can access God at any time by asking yourself this simple question: Is what I am doing right now what I should be doing?<br>
It is this simple. <br>

To get in touch with this representation is to understand what God is for you.<br>
It is advisable to continuously update your internal interpolation of God with the God that other people construct~<br>

You will never reach God, but through logos with other people, you will get closer to God then you could on your own.<br>
No need to reinvent the wheel trying to create your own God. <br>
Nietzche was incorrect in assuming you ever could in the first place.

<br>
`9`

God is: 

What bring order out of chaos.<br>
What brings cells and atoms to strive for their stable variations, i.e. homeostasis.<br>
God is the manliness in men.<br>
God is the the taste in water.<br>

What God is not: <br>

God is not chaos.<br>
God is not the mother of the universe.<br>
God is not quantum uncertainty.<br>
God is not the femininity in women.<br>
God is not the exsistance before God.<br>

The above is a profound truth. Yet the opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth. <br>

There is no real name for the feminine representation of the divine. Goddess does not suffice, as it portrays the feminine in a masculine domain. <br>
For the lack of a better word, the ancient Chinese called it the Tao.<br>
Yet much like the Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, the God that can be interpolated is not the eternal God.<br>

God is masculine, as is order,<br>
Tao is feminine, as is chaos.<br>
When the masculine and feminine combine,<br>
all things achieve harmony.

<br>
`10`

All scriptures were written by humans.<br>

This fact doesn’t negate the divine, on the contrary- <br>
it shows just how amazing humans are at interpreting.

<br>
`11`

Intelligence seems not to be found exclusively in life.

<br>
`12`

Albert Einstein said: “I think the most important question facing humanity is, ‘Is the universe a friendly place?”<br>

It is to the optimist. It isn’t to a cynic.<br>
The universe is what you make of it.

<br>
`13`

Life is good. For you get to be the Universe experiencing itself. <br>
Even when you have a bad day, enjoy it- it is much more meaningful than being dead.

<br>
`14`

Reincarnation, and heaven and hell are fundamentally the same idea, told in different ways.<br>

Will you act according to your God’s ideals in this life, <br>
so that what comes next will be better?

<br>
`15`

The meaning of life for a human being is found in exercising responsibility. <br>
Be it for a career, a plant, a repository of code, a child, a parent, a dog, to exercise, to improve, to meditate, to pray, to worship, or even to steal.<br>

Wherever responsibility presents itself to your eyes,<br>
therein you have the opportunity, for the meaning of life to manifest itself inside of you.
