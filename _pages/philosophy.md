### Some observations on the way things are

<br>
<br>
<br>
`1`

The self is not an illusion of the mind, in the way illusion is usually understood.<br>
Much like an axe is not an illusion of the mind, since it can cut and shape a real tree.<br>

So is the illusion of the self, not an illusion; <br>
it can cut and shape reality itself.

<br>
`2`

The famous question goes: Why did the chicken cross the road? <br>
The answer? To get to the other side.

<br>
`3`

Money, at its core, is a ritual representation of trust.<br>
What good is the currency of a country wheere no one trusts for it to see another day?

<br>
`4`

Whoever believes the origin of the Universe is hydrogen and heat, from which everything arose:<br>

for that person, the realization looms that either everything is conscious - <br>
or nothing is. 

<br>
`5`

Only when you find out there is no free will, <br>
through both deep meditation and exploration of the scientific method and analysis of its results,<br>
only then can you notice your thoughts arising from the darkness,<br>
and willfully begin to steer them.<br>

When one realizes with absolute certainty that there is no free will; <br>
that humans are but a biological algorithm for processing data,<br>
then, maybe one experiences free will for the first time?<br>

True words often seem paradoxical.



<br>
`6`

The universe is filled with entropy. <br>
What exsists here on Earth however, behaves seemingly like a well oiled machine.<br>

The cycles that seem to repeat indefinitely, are divine. <br>
From the laws of physics, to the Hero’s Journey.<br>

Thus God I think god is present on Earth,<br>
and wherever else in the Universe order manifests out of chaos.

<br>
`7`

Every person extrapolates God to the best of their ability. <br>
A person cannot participate in society in any meaningful way unless they do.<br>

What represents human's highest ideal? Is it Jesus, Arjuna, Mohammed, the Socialist Man,  or Lao Tzu’s Master? <br> 
You can access God at any time by asking yourself this simple question: Is what I am doing right now what I should be doing?<br>
It is this simple. <br>

To get in touch with this representation is to understand what God is.<br>
Seems to be advisable to continuously update your internal interpolation of God with the God that other people construct~<br>

You will never reach God, but through logos with other people, you will get closer to God then you could on your own.<br>
No need to reinvent the wheel trying to create your own God. <br>
Nietzche was incorrect in assuming you alone ever could in the first place.

<br>
`8`

The meaning of life for a human being is found in exercising responsibility. <br>
Be it for a career, a plant, a repository of code, a child, a parent, a dog, to exercise, to improve, to meditate, to pray, to worship,...<br>

Wherever responsibility presents itself to your eyes,<br>
therein you have the opportunity, for the meaning of life to manifest itself inside of you.

<br>
`9`

All scriptures were written by humans.<br>

This fact doesn’t negate the divine; on the contrary - <br>
it shows just how amazing humans are at interpreting.

<br>
`11`

Intelligence seems not to be found exclusively in life.<br>
But in life, it is found in abundance.

<br>
`12`

Albert Einstein said: “I think the most important question facing humanity is, is the universe a friendly place?”<br>

Seems it is to the optimist. It isn’t to a cynic.<br>
The universe is what you make of it. For you are the universe experiencing itself.

<br>
`13`

Life is good. For you get to be the Universe experiencing itself. <br>
Even when you have a bad day, enjoy it- it is much more meaningful than being dead.

<br>
`14`

Reincarnation, and heaven and hell are fundamentally the same idea, told in different ways.<br>

Will you act according to your God’s ideals in this life, <br>
so that what comes next will be better?


<br>
`15`

Short term gratification is not a good long term strategy. <br>

<br>
`16`

Bitcoin is the capitalization of markets' trust in the SHA256 algorithm. <br>

<br>
`17`

The more you explore something, the smaller it becomes. <br>
