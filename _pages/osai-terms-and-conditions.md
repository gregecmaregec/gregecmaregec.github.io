### OSAI stands for opensourced ai.<br>

<br>

OSAI is an implmenetation of serving open source LLMs through the internet with a privacy-first approach. No log on is required, your data is not stored or shared to third parties by me.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your chat history is not recorded. Whatever you write to any of the large language models and their response, is for your eyes only.
The conversations you have with the models are inaccessible even by me. When you trigger inference on OSAI, the inference is done locally on my own personal PC, a system with an Intel i5 13600kf CPU and an RTX 3070ti 8GB GPU.<br>
<br>
<br>
The website acts as a gateway to an https server and API that is built using Go, data in transit is encrypted end-to-end with Cloudflare. <br>
<br>
<br>
This website is only functional some of the time, because my personal PC needs to be configured as a Linux server environment to be able to serve https requests as set up now, and I use a Windows desktop environment most of the time, because I like to play videogames.<br>
