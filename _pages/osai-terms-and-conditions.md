### OSAI stands for opensourced ai.<br>
<br>
Your chat history is not recorded. Whatever you write to any of the models and their response, is for your eyes only. 
The conversations you have with the models will be inaccessible even by me. When you trigger inference on OSAI, the computation is done locally on my own personal PC, a system with an Intel i5 13600kf CPU and an RTX 3070ti GPU. Inference nor chat history will never be shared with third parties.<br>
<br>
<br>
The website acts as a gateway to an https server and API that is built using Go, data in transit is encrypted end-to-end with Cloudflare. <br>
<br>
<br>
This website is only functional some of the time, because my personal PC needs to be running a Linux server environment to be able to serve https requests as set up now, and sometimes I want to play videogames, which means I have to boot out of Linux.<br>
