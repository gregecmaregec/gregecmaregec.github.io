### OSAI stands for opensourced AI.<br>

<br>

OSAI is my implementation of serving open source LLMs through the internet with a privacy-first approach. No log on is required, your data is not stored or shared to third parties by me. The only cookie used is for setting the theme between white and dark, completely local.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your chat history is not recorded. Whatever you write to any of the large language models and their response, is for your eyes only.
The conversations you have with the models are inaccessible even by me. Data is encrypted from your machine to my server end-to-end with https. When you trigger inference on OSAI it runs locally on my own personal PC, a system with an Intel i5 13600kf CPU and an RTX 3070ti 8GB GPU.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The website acts as a gateway to an API that I built using Go, data in transit is encrypted end-to-end with Cloudflare, also providing DDOS protection. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This website is only functional some of the time, because my personal PC needs to be configured as a Linux server environment to be able to serve https requests as set up now, and I use a desktop environment most of the time.<br>
