The answer? To get to the other side.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code></p> <p>Money, at its core, is a ritual representation of trust.<br></p> <p>What good is the currency of a country which no one trusts to see another day?</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code></p> <p>The universe is certain.<br></p> <p>Even if in the quantum realm things really are uncertain in the final anaylsis of things,<br> their uncertainty is already integrated into the universe.<br> The certainty encapsulating the uncertain, makes it certain.<br> A certain uncertainty itself is certain. <br></p> <p>The universe has already adjusted to this.<br> You should, too.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code></p> <p>Whoever understands the origin of the Universe as hydrogen and heat, from which everything arose:<br></p> <p>understands that either everything is conscious - <br> or nothing is.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6</code></p> <p>Only when you understand there is no free will, <br> through both deep meditation and exploration of the scientific method and analysis of its results,<br> only then can you notice your thoughts arising from the darkness,<br> and willfully begin to steer them.<br></p> <p>Only when you realize with absolute certainty that there is no free will; <br> that humans are but a biological algorithm for processing data,<br> only then, can you experience free will for the first time.<br></p> <p>True words seem paradoxical.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7</code></p> <p>The universe is filled with entropy. <br> What exsists here on Earth however, behaves rather like a well oiled machine.<br></p> <p>The cycles that seem to repeat indefinitely, are divine. <br> From the laws of physics, to the Hero’s Journey.<br></p> <p>Thus God is present on Earth,<br> and wherever else in the Universe order manifests out of chaos.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8</code></p> <p>Every person extrapolates God to the best of their ability. <br> A person cannot participate in society in any meaningful way unless they do.<br></p> <p>What represents your highest ideal? Is it the socialist man, Arjuna, Jesus, or Lao Tzu’s Master? <br> You can access God at any time by asking yourself this simple question: Is what I am doing right now what I should be doing?<br> It is this simple. <br></p> <p>To get in touch with this representation is to understand what God is for you.<br> It is advisable to continuously update your internal interpolation of God with the God that other people construct~<br></p> <p>You will never reach God, but through logos with other people, you will get closer to God then you could on your own.<br> No need to reinvent the wheel trying to create your own God. <br> Nietzche was incorrect in assuming you ever could in the first place.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9</code></p> <p>God is:</p> <p>What bring order out of chaos.<br> What brings cells and atoms to strive for their stable variations, i.e. homeostasis.<br> God is the manliness in men.<br> God is the the taste in water.<br></p> <p>What God is not: <br></p> <p>God is not chaos.<br> God is not the mother of the universe.<br> God is not quantum uncertainty.<br> God is not the femininity in women.<br> God is not the exsistance before God.<br></p> <p>The above is a profound truth. Yet the opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth. <br></p> <p>There is no real name for the feminine representation of the divine. Goddess does not suffice, as it portrays the feminine in a masculine domain. <br> For the lack of a better word, the ancient Chinese called it the Tao.<br> Yet much like the Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, the God that can be interpolated is not the eternal God.<br></p> <p>God is masculine, as is order,<br> Tao is feminine, as is chaos.<br> When the masculine and feminine combine,<br> all things achieve harmony.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10</code></p> <p>All scriptures were written by humans.<br></p> <p>This fact doesn’t negate the divine, on the contrary- <br> it shows just how amazing humans are at interpreting.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11</code></p> <p>Intelligence seems not to be found exclusively in life.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12</code></p> <p>Albert Einstein said: “I think the most important question facing humanity is, ‘Is the universe a friendly place?”<br></p> <p>It is to the optimist. It isn’t to a cynic.<br> The universe is what you make of it.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13</code></p> <p>Life is good. For you get to be the Universe experiencing itself. <br> Even when you have a bad day, enjoy it- it is much more meaningful than being dead.</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">14</code></p> <p>Reincarnation, and heaven and hell are fundamentally the same idea, told in different ways.<br></p> <p>Will you act according to your God’s ideals in this life, <br> so that what comes next will be better?</p> <p><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15</code></p> <p>The meaning of life for a human being is found in exercising responsibility. <br> Be it for a career, a plant, a repository of code, a child, a parent, a dog, to exercise, to improve, to meditate, to pray, to worship, or even to steal.<br></p> <p>Wherever responsibility presents itself to your eyes,<br> therein you have the opportunity, for the meaning of life to manifest itself inside of you.</p> <p><br> <br> <br> <br></p> <hr> <p><small><i>The writings in this page are the products of my own mind, and in no way represent the views of any employer of mine,<br></i></small> <small><i>-past, present, or future.</i></small><br> <br> <small><i>The writings in this page are not covered under the MIT licence. © 2024 Gregor Mihelac.
